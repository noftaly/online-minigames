# Online mini-games

This project is an online minigame website, to play tic-tac-toe or connect4 with your friends! More games are to come,
I plan to add the handman, battleship and monopoly. You can see the TODO list on the main page.
None of the UI is definitive, I've just set up bootstrap to have something decent to use while developing it.

## Prerequisites
- Nodejs and npm should be installed. To see how to install those, see [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Mongodb ("Community Edition" (ie local)) should be installed. To see how to install it, see [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

## Using the website
- Start installing the packages with `npm i`
- Then you can simply run the website by taping `npm start` in this directory.
- You can now go to http://localhost:5000/ and enjoy!
